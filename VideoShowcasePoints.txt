# Required ShowcasePoints - (Nathan: This will be pretty much everything in ProgressTacker.txt)
1. Show how we start the filesystem using `rdbash`

# Bonus ShowcasePoints
1. We can do history (Reverse Lookup + Tab Completion)
2. Our permission bits are legit bits not just an integer
3. ls can do `ls *` to seperate the first child directories
4. Our utilities are in memory as files
5. We can do globs
6. We can cd using relative paths `../`
7. Our grep can be recursive
8. Our cd can cd to a symbolic link that is a directory
9. How we tested quickly (Upload Script allow us to specify the root for a smaller DB)
10. Handle empty database rdbsh by automatically creating the root
11. We add rmdir to handle the empty directory deleting case, and we can delete recrusively with rm -r
12. We have the ability to add users, login in as them, and much more
    - Here are some test cases
    root@/# useradd nathan1
    Begin creating user
    Inserted this User
    root@/# useradd nathan1
    useradd: user nathan1 already exists
    root@/# useradd -u 1000 nathan1
    useradd: UID 1000 is not unique
    root@/# useradd -u 1000 nathan2
    useradd: UID 1000 is not unique
    root@/# useradd -u 1001 nathan1
    useradd: UID 1001 is not unique
    root@/# useradd -u 0 nathan1
    useradd: UID 0 is not unique
    root@/#
