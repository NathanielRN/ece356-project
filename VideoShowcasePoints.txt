# Required ShowcasePoints - (Nathan: This will be pretty much everything in ProgressTacker.txt)
1. Show how we start the filesystem using `rdbash`

# Bonus ShowcasePoints
1. We can do history (Reverse Lookup + Tab Completion)
2. Our permission bits are legit bits not just an integer
3. ls can do `ls *` to seperate the first child directories
4. Our utilities are in memory as files
5. We can do globs
6. We can cd using relative paths `../`
7. Our grep can be recursive
8. Our cd can cd to a symbolic link that is a directory
9. How we tested quickly (Upload Script allow us to specify the root for a smaller DB)
10. Handle empty database rdbsh by automatically creating the root
11. We add rmdir to handle the empty directory deleting case, and we can delete recrusively with rm -r


rename -f 's/(\w+).py/..\/setup\/rootfs\/test\/bin\/$1/g' *
